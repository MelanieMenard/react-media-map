# React Media Map

Demo App fetching pictures related to a predefined list of Artists' Homes on Flickr API. View all locations, or filter images by location. Show relative popularity using D3 based on total matching images on the server (even though we only fetch 20 fot this demo).

Bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Deployed to Heroku with zero-configuration using [Heroku Buildpack for create-react-app](https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack).

Uses React, Redux, Redux thunk, Axios, Webpack, SASS and D3.
